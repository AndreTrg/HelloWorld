Hi all! 

My name is Andreas. I am from Iraklion, the capital city of Crete island in Greece.
I graduated from the Dept. of Informatics Engineer (T.E.I of Crete) in 2014 and right now I am working as Python developer.
This is my first try on GitHub and I would like to learn more about Git and version control.

Thanks for reading :)
